      <title>Exercise 1.0 - Running Ad hoc commands</title>
      <link>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/ansible_tower/exercise1.0/</link>

      <description>Exercise Description For our first exercise, we are going to run some ad hoc commands to help you get a feel for how Red Hat Ansible Tower works. Ansible ad hoc commands enable you to perform repeatable tasks on remote nodes, without having to write a playbook. They are very useful when you simply need to do one or two tasks quickly and often, to many remote nodes.
 Set Up Dependencies: Define your inventory.</description>

      <title>Exercise 1.1 - Writing Your First Playbook</title>
      <link>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/ansible_tower/exercise1.1/</link>

      <description>Exercise Description Now that you&amp;#8217;ve gotten a sense of how Red Hat Ansible Tower works, we are going to write our first Ansible playbook. The playbook is where you can take some of those ad hoc commands you just ran and put them into a repeatable set of plays and tasks.
 A playbook can have multiple plays and a play can have one or multiple tasks. The goal of a play is to map a group of hosts.</description>

      <description>Section 1: Running the playbook We are now going to run your brand-new playbook, on your two web nodes. To do this, you are going to use the ansible-playbook command.
 Step 1: Run your playbook From your playbook directory ( ~/apache_basic ), run your playbook.
 ansible-playbook -i ../hosts install_apache.yml --private-key=~/.ssh/example-tower   However, before you run that command, lets take a few moments to understand the options.
   --private-key This option asks for the private ssh key to connect to the remote machine.</description>

      <title>Exercise 1.3 - Using Variables, Loops, and Handlers</title>

      <description>Exercise Description In previous exercises, we showed you the basics of the Ansible core. In the next few exercises, we are going to teach some more advanced Ansible skills that will add flexibility and power to your playbooks.
 Ansible exists to make tasks simple and repeatable. We also know that not all systems are exactly alike and often require some slight customization to the way an Ansible playbook is run.</description>

      <description>Congratulations! You just wrote a playbook that incorporates some key Ansible concepts that you use in most, if not all, of your future playbooks. Before you get too excited though, we should probably make sure it actually runs. So, let&amp;#8217;s do that now.
   Section 1: Running your new apache playbook Step 1: Create a host file Make sure you are in the correct directory and create a host file.</description>

      <title>Exercise 1.5 - Roles: Making your playbooks reusable</title>
      <link>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/ansible_tower/exercise1.5/</link>

      <guid>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/ansible_tower/exercise1.5/</guid>
      <description>Exercise Description While it is possible to write a playbook in one file, as we&amp;#8217;ve done throughout this workshop, eventually youâ€™ll want to reuse files and start to organize things.
 The &#34;role&#34; feature in Ansible is the way we do this. When you create a role, you deconstruct your playbook into parts and those parts sit in a directory structure. &#34;Wha?? You mean that seemingly useless best practice you mentioned in exercise 1.</description>

      <title>Exercise 2.0 - Installing Ansible Tower</title>
      <link>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/ansible_tower/exercise2.0/</link>

      <description>Exercise Description In this exercise, we are going to get Ansible Tower installed on your control node.
 Step 1: Change directories Change directories to /tmp
 cd /tmp    Step 2: Download Red Hat Ansible Tower Download the latest Ansible Tower package
 curl -O https://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/setup/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz    Step 3: Untar and unzip the package file tar xvfz /tmp/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz    Step 4: Change directories Change directories into the Ansible Tower setup package</description>

      <title>Exercise 2.1 - Configuring Ansible Tower</title>
      <link>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/ansible_tower/exercise2.1/</link>

      <guid>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/ansible_tower/exercise2.1/</guid>
      <description>Exercise Description In this exercise, we are going to configure Red Hat Ansible Tower, so that we can run a playbook.
 There are a number of constructs in the Ansible Tower UI that enable multi-tenancy, notifications, scheduling, etc. However, we are only going to focus on the key concepts required for this workshop today.
   Credentials
  Projects
  Inventory
  Job Template

      <title>Exercise 2.2 - Creating and Running a Job Template</title>
      <link>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/ansible_tower/exercise2.2/</link>

      <guid>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/ansible_tower/exercise2.2/</guid>
      <description>Exercise Description This exercise will walk you through the steps required to create a job template and run it. A job template is a definition and set of parameters for running an Ansible job. In other words, a template combines an Ansible project playbook and the settings required to launch it, into one package.
 Templates save setup time, for jobs that are launched repetitively. Once the template is set, it can be edited for future jobs, with different settings.</description>

      <description>Exercise Description In this exercise, we are going to use Red Hat Ansible Tower to run a DISA STIG evaluation of our environment.
   DISA STIG controls https://galaxy.ansible.com/redhatofficial/rhel7_disa_stig
   Step 1: Download role to Ansible roles directory In your wetty window (if you closed it, see the SETUP step, in your workbook), type the following:
 sudo ansible-galaxy install redhatofficial.rhel7_disa_stig -p /etc/ansible/roles   The image below illustrates that the role has been downloaded to your system-wide Ansible roles directory, /etc/ansible/roles:</description>

      <description>What you will learn: Wetty (Browser-based SSH) This lab provides a quick tour of the browser based SSH client &#39;Wetty&#39;. To help you get familiar with lab environment along with some key terminology we will use in subsequent lab content.
   Accessing Wetty Use this URL to access the Wetty node, just change the workshop name (if applicable). Ask your instructor for the workshop name.</description>

      <description>That wraps up what we have planned for today. We hope you&amp;#8217;ve learned something valuable about Ansible and Red Hat Ansible Tower that you can apply in your daily role.
 What do you think? How can we help you understand Ansible Tower better?
 Before you leave, check out the Resources page that is part of this guide. There, you can find a ton of links that will further your Ansible education.</description>
