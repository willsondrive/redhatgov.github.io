      <description>Exercise 1.0: Installing Buildah, Skopeo and Podman Set up dependencies Elevate privileges
 In order to do any of the steps in the Containers 101 Workshop, you will need root privileges. There are two methods of doing this; the method you choose is up to you. Either method will work, but in a production environment, Method 2 is much more secure and auditable.
 Method 1: The first, and easiest, method is to start a root session, with sudo -i:</description>

      <description>Exercise 1.1 - Pulling Container Images   Section 1: Pull RHEL Images Step 1. Use the following command to pull a RHEL image from the Red Hat repository: podman pull command podman pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7   Images are accessed using the container registry URL (registry.access.redhat.com). If the container registry URL is not specified in the pull command, it could result in the retrieval of an image that originates from an untrusted registry.</description>

      <description>Exercise 1.2 - Working with Container Images   Exercise Description In this exercise, you&amp;#8217;ll learn the fundamentals of container images, including how to run them and how to see what is inside of a container. Container storage volumes will be discussed, showing how to mount external file systems, with useful functions and data. We will also discuss container metadata and explain what types of information you can get from them.</description>

      <description>Exercise 1.3 - Working with the Dockerfile   Exercise Description This exercise will enable you to use a Dockerfile to build a container. Once you understand how images and containers can be created from the command line, you can try building containers in a more permanent way.
 Building container images from Dockerfile files is, by far, the preferred way to create docker-formatted containers, as compared to modifying running containers and committing them to images.</description>

      <description>Setup for Containers 101   Conventions Used in this Workshop When something written is a command that you should type, it is separated in a code block, like this:
 echo &#34;hello, world!&#34;   And the output will be shown in a block, like this:
 hello, world!     What you will learn This lab provides a quick tour of the browser based SSH client Wetty.</description>
