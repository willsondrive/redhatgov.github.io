      <description>Congratulations You have gone through a methodical process to develop container technology that is custom to a framework, yet repeatable. We have:
 Run the application from the command line to understand what it does and how it is supposed to behave.
 Containerized the applicaiton.
 Built Source-to-Image mechanisms that allow us to inject raw source code to be built inside the container.
 Created an OpenShift template to make repeated deployments easier.</description>

      <description>Exercise 1.2 - Docker USER   Exercise Description Now that you&amp;#8217;ve gotten a sense of software provenance in Dockerfiles lets take a look at the USER in Dockerfiles.
 By default docker containers run as root. A docker container running as root has full control of the host system. As docker matures, more secure default options may become available. For now, requiring root is dangerous for others and may not be available in all environments.</description>

      <description>Before we get into OpenShift lets explore what Linux Kernel Capabilities are and some of the steps that OpenShift has taken to remove certain capabilities by default.
   What are Linux Capabilities? According to the capabilities man page;
 Capabilities are distinct units of privilege that can be independently enabled or disabled.
 Capabilities were added to the kernel around 15 or so years ago to try to divide up the power of root.</description>

      <description>Section 1: Running the playbook We are now going to run your brand-new playbook, on your two web nodes. To do this, you are going to use the ansible-playbook command.
 Step 1: Run your playbook From your playbook directory ( ~/apache_basic ), run your playbook.
 ansible-playbook -i ../hosts install_apache.yml --private-key=~/.ssh/example-tower   However, before you run that command, lets take a few moments to understand the options.
   --private-key This option asks for the private ssh key to connect to the remote machine.</description>

      <description>SELinux is primarily a labeling system that assigns a label (name) to every process and system object. This allows every aspect of kernel operations to be first labeled, second classified, and then ultimately enforced by a set of rules that the provider maintains.
 BENEFITS OF RUNNING SELINUX
   All processes and files are labeled with a type. A type defines a domain for processes, and a type for files.</description>

      <description>Red Hat Container Catalog
  While public registries and uncurated repositories are acceptable for some cloud-native development and proof-of-concept projects, they do not always provide content that is fit for production consumption; enterprise workloads require enterprise-ready tools.   MATTHEW HICKSVICE PRESIDENT, ENGINEERING, OPENSHIFT AND MANAGEMENT, RED HAT
 While container-based applications have begun moving into production, not all containers are created or maintained equally. Every container starts with a Linux base layer, which means that every ISV building container images is distributing Linux content.</description>

      <description>Exercise 1.7 - Seccomp   Exercise Description Secure Computing Mode (seccomp) is a kernel feature that enables you to filter system calls to the kernel from a container. The combination of restricted and allowed calls are arranged in profiles, and you can pass different profiles to different containers. Seccomp provides more fine-grained control than capabilities, giving an attacker a limited number of syscalls from the container. This exercise examines how seccomp works and how it can be employed to provide container security.</description>

      <description>Exercise 1.8 - SELinux   Exercise Description Let&amp;#8217;s move on to Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux). We will cover SELinux basics, Docker SELinux security policy and the &#34;SELinux Coloring Book.&#34;
   Section 1: Basics of SELINUX In this section, we’ll cover the basics of SELinux and containers. SELinux policy prevents a lot of break out situations, where the other security mechanisms fail. With SELinux on Docker, we write policy that says that the container process running as svirt_lxc_net_t can only read/write files with the svirt_sandbox_file_t label.</description>

      <description>Image Stream Image streams can be used to automatically perform an action when new images are created. Builds and deployments can watch an image stream to receive notifications when new images are added and react by performing a build or deployment, respectively.
 For example, if a deployment is using a certain image and a new version of that image is created, a deployment could be automatically performed.</description>

      <description>Exercise Description This exercise will walk you through the steps required to create a job template and run it. A job template is a definition and set of parameters for running an Ansible job. In other words, a template combines an Ansible project playbook and the settings required to launch it, into one package.
 Templates save setup time, for jobs that are launched repetitively. Once the template is set, it can be edited for future jobs, with different settings.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses Markdown for its simple content format. However, there are a lot of things that Markdown doesn’t support well.
We are unwilling to accept being constrained by our simple format. Also unacceptable is writing raw HTML in our Markdown every time we want to include unsupported content such as a video. To do so is in complete opposition to the intent of using a bare-bones format for our content and utilizing templates to apply styling for display.</description>

      <description>Introduction Now we want to containerize the Gochat app. If you are using the CLI on your own computer, you could use the docker command. However, if you are in the Wetty terminal, remember you are actually in a container. We could have exposed the container socket on the host to your Wetty container. However, this would break the security model.
Fortunately we can build from a Dockerfile using the oc command line tool.</description>

      <description>Microservice Integration Patterns  In previous labs, we created two new microservices with the intention of replacing functionality (“strangling”) the monolithic application. Currently no traffic is routed to them. If you were to re-route traffic from the monolith’s /services/products API to the new catalog service’s /services/catalog endpoint, you would be missing the inventory data. In this lab we will consider different options and architectures for integrating the microservices’ functionality into our app.</description>

      <description>In an attempt at nostalgia, we are going to once again create an S2I builder, this time for a Fortran app. Yes, Fortran. The objective is to make our little chat program a bit more interesting.
Step 1 - Create the S2I Project cd ~  s2i create fortran-s2i fortran-s2i  Step 2 - Edit the Dockerfile cd ~  cat /dev/null &amp;gt; ~/fortran-s2i/Dockerfile  vi ~/fortran-s2i/Dockerfile  Copy the following text and paste it in to the editor.</description>

      <description>Step 1 - Create a Route to the Gochat Service First we expose the pod with a service.
oc expose dc wetty --port=8080 --target-port=8080 --name=gochat  Then we expose the service with a route.
oc expose svc gochat  Step 2 - Download the App Source go get -d github.com/kevensen/openshift-gochat-client  Step 3 - Build the App cd go/src/github.com/kevensen/openshift-gochat-client  glide install -v &amp;amp;&amp;amp; go install  Step 4 - Annotate the Service Account to Use OpenShift Authorization These annotations allow for the Gochat Client to communicate to the OpenShift API for user credential verification.</description>

      <description>Strangling the Monolith Design Pattern  Strangling - incrementally replacing functionality in app with something better (cheaper, faster, easier to maintain). As functionality is replaced, “dead” parts of monolith can be removed/retired. You can also wait for all functionality to be replaced before retiring anything! You can optionally include new functionality during strangulation to make it more attractive to business stakeholders.   https://paulhammant.com/2013/07/14/legacy-application-strangulation-case-studies/

      <description>Before moving forward, it is important to understand the difference between Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and Continuous Deployment.
Also, a part of this lab we’ll be using using Pipelines in OpenShift for CI/CD, which gives you control over building, deploying, and promoting your applications on OpenShift. Using a combination of the Jenkins Pipeline Build Strategy, Jenkinsfiles, and the OpenShift Domain Specific Language (DSL) (provided by the OpenShift Jenkins Client Plug-in), you can create advanced build, test, deploy, and promote pipelines for any scenario.</description>

      <description>Lab 8 API Consumption Connect Applications and APIs  Duration: 15 mins Audience: API Consumers, Developers, Architects  
Overview APIs provide the building blocks for applications, but it is applications which deliver functionality to the end users. hence to see APIs in action it helps to see how applications can call APIs to provide new functionality. In this lab you&#39;ll be able to create a simple web application which consumes the API you built earlier in the exercises.</description>

      <description>Static Application Security Testing Next we will add a Code Analysis Stage into the pipeline.
We will leverage the Maven Sonar plugin to run SonarQube scanning against our source code.
SonarQube is an open source static code analysis tool that we can use to automate running security scans against your source code to further improve the security of your application. Every time you check-in code, SonarQube will scan the quality and perform a threat analysis of that code.</description>

      <description>Add Archive Stage Archiving the built and tested application into a trusted repository is important to making sure you are building with trusted parts. You assume this application is built properly and all the previous stages have passed. With that confidence, your built and tested application should be immutable in a trusted repository. The repository will version or audit any changes to the application, configuration, and dependencies.
Add Archive Stage Steps into your pipeline.</description>

      <description>Containers Containers are an important foundation for your application in building a Trusted Software Supply Chain. You want a secure and blessed golden container image that your application will inherit security controls from.
Containers are built using a layered approach. For example, to create a container of a Java web application, you could do so in multiple layers: the OS, the JVM, the web server, and the code itself.</description>

We first check if an deployment config for the Dev Project already exists. If it does not exists, a new application is created and deployment config is defined for the Dev Project.
Before a trigger is created, the pipeline sleeps for 10 seconds. A deployment configuration can contain triggers, which drive the creation of new deployment processes in response to events inside the cluster.</description>

      <description>Source to Image (S2I) One of the useful components of OpenShift is its source-to-image capability. S2I is a framework that makes it easy to turn your source code into runnable images. The main advantage of using S2I for building reproducible docker images is the ease of use for developers. You&#39;ll see just how simple it can be in this lab.
Let&#39;s build a node.js web server using S2I We can do this either via the command line or the web console.</description>

      <description>Floating IP vs. Private IP Addresses Private IP Address A private IP address is assigned to an instance&#39;s network-interface by the DHCP server. The address is visible from within the instance by using a command like “ip a”. The address is typically part of a private network and is used for communication between instances in the same broadcast domain via virtual switch (L2 agent on each compute node). It can also be accessible from instances in other private networks via virtual router (L3 agent).</description>

      <description>Security Groups in OpenStack A security group is a named collection of network access rules that are used to limit the types of traffic that have access to instances. When you launch an instance, you can assign one or more security groups to it. If you do not create security groups, new instances are automatically assigned to the default security group, unless you explicitly specify a different security group.</description>

 Images uploaded to the Image service
 Image that you have copied to a persistent volume. The instance launches from the volume, which is provided by the cinder-volume API through iSCSI
 Instance snapshot that you took  Let&#39;s Go Launch a New Instance  Navigate to Compute -&amp;gt; Instances using the second level navigation tabs</description>

      <description>Things will go wrong, and that&#39;s why we have replication and recovery Things will go wrong with your software, or your hardware, or from something out of your control. But we can plan for that failure, and planning for it let&#39;s us minimize the impact. OpenShift supports this via what we call replication and recovery.
Replication Let&#39;s walk through a simple example of how the replication controller can keep your deployment at a desired state.</description>

      <description>Labels This is a pretty simple lab, we are going to explore labels. You can use labels to organize, group, or select API objects.
For example, pods are &amp;quot;tagged&amp;quot; with labels, and then services use label selectors to identify the pods they proxy to. This makes it possible for services to reference groups of pods, even treating pods with potentially different docker containers as related entities.
Labels on a pod In a previous lab we added our web app using a S2I template.</description>

      <description>Okay. UIs Are Cool and All, But Can&#39;t I Just Use the CLI? Absolutely! There are 3 ways to interact with OpenStack.
 APIs
 CLIs
 Horizon  In this lab, we are going to walk through some of the activities that we did in the previous labs via the CLIs.
 When you see a CLI command starting with openstack, the command is part of the Unified CLI.</description>

      <description>Summary During this lab, we will verify that the OpenShift components in our environment are deployed as expceted and are up and running.
Go ahead and navigate to the Web Console for your cluster to ensure that you are able to access the login screen.
The URL to your Web Console will be in the format of https://studentXX.example.com/.
Cluster Admin To start, you need to create a user with the cluster-admin role that can be used to see all of the OpenShift components and projects.</description>

      <description>CI/CD Defined In modern software projects many teams utilize the concept of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). By setting up a tool chain that continuously builds, tests, and stages software releases, a team can ensure that their product can be reliably released at any time. OpenShift can be an enabler in the creation and management of this tool chain.
In this lab we walk through creating a simple example of a CI/CD pipeline utlizing Jenkins, all running on top of OpenShift!</description>

      <description>We Have Done a Ton of Stuff, But All Manually. How Do We Orchestrate? In OpenStack, the answer to that is Heat.
Heat is the main project in the OpenStack Orchestration program. It implements an orchestration engine to launch multiple composite cloud applications based on templates in the form of text files that can be treated like code. A native Heat template format is evolving, but Heat also endeavours to provide compatibility with the AWS CloudFormation template format, so that many existing CloudFormation templates can be launched on OpenStack.</description>

      <description>Summary To wrap up this workshop, we will finish by deploying a sample application in our newly installed OpenShift cluster.
Create New User To start, you will to create a new user that does not have the cluster-admin role.
Since we used the HTPasswd identity provider for this installation, you are going to create user credentials for your cluster. The file that contains the users for your HTPasswd identity provider is located at /etc/origin/master/htpasswd on the master node.</description>

      <guid>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/openshift_101_dcmetromap/lab9-bluegreen/</guid>
      <description>Blue/Green deployments When implementing continuous delivery for your software one very useful technique is called Blue/Green deployments. It addresses the desire to minimize downtime during the release of a new version of an application to production. Essentially, it involves running two production versions of your app side-by-side and then switching the routing from the last stable version to the new version once it is verified. Using OpenShift, this can be very seamless because using containers we can easily and rapidly deploy a duplicate infrastructure to support alternate versions and modify routes as a service.</description>

      <description>Working With Block and Object Storage in OpenStack Block Storage is Handled by Cinder The OpenStack Block Storage service works through the interaction of a series of daemon processes named cinder-* that reside persistently on the host machine or machines. You can run all the binaries from a single node, or spread across multiple nodes. You can also run them on the same node as other OpenStack services.
To administer the OpenStack Block Storage service, it is helpful to understand a number of concepts.</description>

      <description>Getting Started This entire site, including the workshop content, is built using a tool named Hugo. Hugo is known as a &amp;quot;static site generator&amp;quot; where the content you build is pre-compiled before being served by a web server.
The Good News The good news is that you don&#39;t have to worry about how Hugo works, how to configure it, or how everything gets deployed.
All of that is being handled for you and you can focus on the content of your workshop.</description>
